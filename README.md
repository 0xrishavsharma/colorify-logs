# Colorify Logs Library - Leave your boring simple logs, instead Colorify your logs

### A simple library to help you beautify your console logs. This library is in development and is not yet ready for production.

#### Feel free to fork it, customize it and make it your own. 

This library allows you to use 4 types of console log methods:
    1. log.info("Your message")
    2. log.success("Your message")
    3. log.warning("Your message")
    4. log.danger("Your message")

Library inherits the in build properties of the Console. 

This package was made possible due to the tutorial published by Rakesh K on his YouTube channel. Please show your support to him. Link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmnv3g3cy-w&t=1171s
