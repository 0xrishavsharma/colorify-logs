# Colorify Logs Library 
## Leave your boring simple logs, instead Colorify your logs 

#### This library allows you to log 4 different types of messages in your browser console:
    1. Log.info("Your info message")
    2. Log.success("Your success message")
    3. Log.warning("Your warning message")
    4. Log.danger("Your danger message")

A simple library to help you beautify your console log statements. Library inherits the in build properties of the Console. Feel free to fork it, customize it and make it your own.

This package was made possible due to the tutorial published by Rakesh K on his YouTube channel. Please show your support to him. Link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmnv3g3cy-w&t=1171s
